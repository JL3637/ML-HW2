1. (d)<br>
2. (a)<br>
   Prove: There is two upper bound for d_vc, one is depend on the dimension of x which is d_vc <= 6210 + 1, and the other one is depend on the number of perceptrons, since one perceptron can implement one dichotomy, we can use 2^N <= 1126 to find out d_vc <= lg(1126). And it is obvious that d_vc <= lg(1126) is a tighter bound.
3. (e)<br>
   Prove:<br>
   (a) d_vc = 4, since for N = 5, we can't implement {1, -1, 1, -1, 1} this dichotomy.<br>
   (b) d_vc = 4, since mh(5) < 2^5, because {1, -1, 1, -1, 1} and {-1, 1, -1, 1, -1} are both not dichotomies.<br>
   (c) d_vc = infinity, since sin is a oscillation function by putting N points properly we can implement 2^N dichotomies by changing different w.<br>
   (d) d_vc = 4, since no set of 5 points can be fully shattered. By similar labeling in (e) we can label four extreme point plus one inside the four. Then it is impossible to label the point inside negative while the extreme points is labeled positively.<br>
   (e) d_vc = 3, since no set of 4 points can be fully shattered. We can label four extreme points with P_top, P_down, P_left, P_right. Assuming P_top_y - P_down_y > P_right_x - P_left_x, then P_top and P_down can't be labeled positively while P_left and P_right are labeled negatively.<br>

   • some set of d distinct inputs is shattered by H
   • any set of d + 1 distinct inputs is not shattered by H
